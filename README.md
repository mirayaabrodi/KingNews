# King News :crown:

A website that is based on the latest news :tada:

## The Background Behind This Project :book:

I wanted to strengthen my skill on `css-grid`. So i thougth to myself, why not make A website that is based on the latest news. I wanted to make something similar to "CNN" and "The New York Times", but at the same time more elegant and professional. The color theme is gold, black and dark gray, which are colors that do not bother the eyes so much when you look at all the texts and images, basically calm colors for the eyes. :blush:

## What I learned :brain:

- Heavily focused on `css-grid`
